# School District Analysis (Give different title)
## Purpose

Standardized test data for math and reading from various schools within a district were used to conduct an analysis. The purpose of this analysis was to provide insight on performance trends that would be used to aid in making decisions on both a school and district level.

## Results

### •	District Summary: 
           By altering ninth-grade student data for Thomas High School, you could only see a slight change in the district summary data. This means ninth-grade scores for math and reading did not necessarily contribute or make a difference to the overall average of the school's scores.
